# **Memory Forensics with Volatility: A Command CheatSheet**

## Step 1: Identifying the Memory Dump Profile

The first step in memory forensics using Volatility is to determine the profile of your memory dump file. To do this, use the following command:

```bash
volatility -f Path_To_File imageinfo
```

The imageinfo command helps identify the profile of the memory dump, which is essential for further analysis.

## Fundamental Volatility Commands

Once you\`ve identified the memory dump\`s profile, you can start utilizing Volatility\`s powerful plugins. Here are some fundamental commands to get you started:

### Process Analysis

#### List All Processes

```bash
volatility -f Path_To_File --profile=Profile_Name pslist
```

The pslist command provides a list of all processes running in memory at the time of the memory dump.

#### Detect Hidden Processes

```bash
volatility -f Path_To_File --profile=Profile_Name psxview
```

The psxview command compares different data sources to detect hidden or unlisted processes in memory.

#### View Process Tree

```bash
volatility -f Path_To_File --profile=Profile_Name pstree
```

The pstree command displays the process tree, showing parent-child relationships between processes.

### Command History Analysis

#### List Executed Commands

```bash
volatility -f Path_To_File --profile=Profile_Name cmdscan
```

The cmdscan command lists all executed commands from the memory dump, providing insight into user activity.

#### View Executed Command Output

```bash
volatility -f Path_To_File --profile=Profile_Name consoles
```

The consoles command reveals the output of commands executed from consoles, which can help trace user actions.

### Data Extraction

#### Retrieve Clipboard Content

```bash
volatility -f Path_To_File --profile=Profile_Name clipboard
```

The clipboard command retrieves content from the system\`s clipboard, potentially uncovering sensitive information.

#### View Environment Variables

```bash
volatility -f Path_To_File --profile=Profile_Name envars
```

The envars command displays environment variables from the memory dump, offering clues about the system\`s configuration.

### File System Analysis

#### Scan for Files

```bash
volatility -f Path_To_File --profile=Profile_Name filescan | grep Documents
```

The filescan command scans memory for file objects, and you can use grep to filter results for specific directories.

#### Dump Files

```bash
volatility -f Path_To_File --profile=Profile_Name dumpfiles -Q 0x0000000017663e7 -D .
```

Use the -Q option with an address to dump specific files from memory for further analysis.

### Memory Analysis

#### Dump Memory of Specific Processes

```bash
volatility -f Path_To_File --profile=Profile_Name memdump -p 231 -D .
```

The memdump command allows you to dump the memory of specific processes for closer inspection.

#### View Process Commands

```bash
volatility -f Path_To_File --profile=Profile_Name cmdline -p 123,234
```

The cmdline command shows the command line arguments for specific processes, providing insight into their behavior.

### Registry Analysis

#### List Registry Hives

```bash
volatility -f Path_To_File --profile=Profile_Name hivelist
```

The hivelist command lists all registry hives found in the memory dump.

#### Extract Registry Keys

```bash
volatility -f Path_To_File --profile=Profile_Name printkey -K "Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run"
```

The printkey command extracts specific registry keys, which can reveal autostart programs and other system configurations.

### Timeline Analysis

#### Explore Deleted and Modified Files

```bash
volatility -f Path_To_File --profile=Profile_Name mftparser
```

The mftparser command allows you to examine the Master File Table, uncovering deleted or modified files.

#### Retrieve Last Shutdown Time

```bash
volatility -f Path_To_File --profile=Profile_Name shutdowntime
```

The shutdowntime command reveals the system\`s last shutdown time, helping establish a timeline of events.

### Visual Evidence

#### Capture Screenshots

```bash
volatility -f Path_To_File --profile=Profile_Name screenshot -D .
```

The screenshot command captures and saves screenshots of active desktops, providing visual evidence of user activity.

### String Searching

#### Search for Interesting Strings

```bash
strings Challenge.raw | grep "Mega"
strings Challenge.raw | grep "Pastebin"
strings Challenge.raw | grep "Passwords"
strings Challenge.raw | grep "Flag{"
```

Use the strings command to search for specific keywords in memory dumps, which can highlight potentially sensitive data.

## Leveraging External Plugins

Extend Volatility\`s functionality by installing additional plugins like Chrome history and Firefox history analyzers. Clone the GitHub repository for these plugins:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/superponible/volatility-plugins
```

These plugins provide additional capabilities:

*   **firefoxhistory.py**: Extract Firefox browsing history, cookies, and downloads
*   **chromehistory.py**: Extract Chrome browsing history, visits, search terms, and downloads
*   **prefetch.py**: Scan memory for prefetch files and extract timestamps
*   **idxparser.py**: Scan memory for Java IDX files and extract details

## Practice for Proficiency

To hone your memory forensic skills, consider working on real-world challenges. The "MemLabs" GitHub repository offers six challenges, ranging from basic to advanced, providing an excellent opportunity for hands-on practice.
